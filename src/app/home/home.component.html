<h3>🌊 Welcome to Tide UI
    Build Better Interfaces with Fully Custom Web Components
    Tide UI is a powerful collection of custom-built web components designed to help developers create clean, dynamic, and accessible user interfaces—without the overhead of heavy frameworks.
    
    With native support for dark/light themes, multi-language layouts (LTR/RTL), form integration, and event-driven interaction, each component is crafted to plug directly into modern frontend stacks, including Angular, React, and plain HTML/JS.
    
    ⚙️ Key Features
    ✅ Component-Based Architecture
    <!-- Use flexible elements like <t-dropdown>, <t-tabs>, <t-multidropdown>, and more. -->
    
    🎨 Theme Customization
    Choose between dark or light themes, or apply your own styles with ease.
    
    🌐 Language & RTL Support
    Built-in support for languages like Arabic and English with proper direction handling.
    
    🔍 Rich Interactivity
    Components emit custom events (tdropdown, ttabs, etc.) so you can hook in and react with ease.
    
    🔗 Framework-Friendly

    Built with native Web Component standards — no external libraries required.
    
    🧪 Form Integration Ready
    <!-- Components like <t-input>, <t-checkbox>, and <t-dropdown> support form submission out of the box. -->
